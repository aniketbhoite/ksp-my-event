KSP, Kotlin Symbol Processing is answer to annotation processing for Kotlin by [google](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/02/announcing-kotlin-symbol-processing-ksp.html). It replaces older Kapt(Kotlin Annotations Processing) which was slower and less flexible to support native features of Kotlin language. 


KSP (or Kapt) is useful for meta-programming and writing repetitive code. We analyse code and use code to write code
